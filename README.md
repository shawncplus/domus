Domus
=====

I plan for domus to be my replacement for iGoogle. I don't know if I'm going to host it for others to use or have this project be a server that everyone can run on their own. Probably both.

 * in PHP - https://github.com/shawncplus/domus/tree/master
 * in nodejs - https://github.com/shawncplus/domus/tree/node
 * other languages possibly coming soon...
