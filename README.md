Domus
=====

I plan for domus to be my replacement for iGoogle. I don't know if I'm going to host it for others to use or have this project be a server that everyone can run on their own. Probably both.

 * in PHP - https://github.com/shawncplus/domus/tree/master
 * in nodejs - https://github.com/shawncplus/domus/tree/node
 * other languages possibly coming soon...

TODO List
----

 * Tabs - Allow you to have different tabs
 * Non-rss items - Allow you to have things besides rss feeds. OpenSocial seems to be the leading suggestion at the moment. I really want to get gmail in there like the original iGoogle. I may be able to fuss with an iframed mobile gmail...


Known Issues
----

   Node version:
 * Caching issue sometimes shows a different widget's content.
   * **Bandaid:** Edit the widget and save without changing anything will force a refresh
